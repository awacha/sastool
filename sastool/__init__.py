 SASTool: a Python package for small-angle scattering
======================================================

Written by Andras Wacha (awacha at gmail dot com)

This library is intended for small-angle scatterers working at large-scale
facilities (synchrotron beamlines or neutrons) and at smaller laboratories. The
aim of this project is to create a toolchain for quick on-site data analysis,
data post-processing and fitting. I wrote (write) this with the requirement of
readability in mind, learning from an older project of mine (``B1python``,
http://github.com/awacha/B1python). Much of the code in this has been simply
taken over from ``B1python`` and ``py_scidatatools``, with refactoring, simplifying
and restructuring.

The library consists of the following sub-packages:

- `io`: input-output routines, for loading various raw and reduced measurement
  files.
- `dataset`: a class-hierarchy for representing measured datasets and facilitating
  operations on them (fitting, arithmetics, plotting etc.)
- `misc`: miscellaneous utility macros
- `utils2d`: utilities for treating two-dimensional scattering data (integrating,
  finding the beam center, plotting etc.)
- `fitting`: framework for nonlinear least-squares fitting
- `sim`: Simulation routines

Please notice that this code is under development. The API is still subject to
changes, until the first major release (expected maybe in the second half of
2012). Please be patient (or help me out... ;-))
